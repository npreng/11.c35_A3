			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>
		<p>
			My question for visualization was "How does the difference 
			in gender populations vary based on birth year?"
		</p>

      <figure>
				<img src="./Vis &amp; Society Assignment 3_files/1.png" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					This sketch displays the numberical difference between men and women for each age range in 
					the year 2000. If a bar is below the x axis, that range has more men, and 
					if a bar is above the x axis, that range has more women.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					This preliminary graph looks like a very nice sine curve so far!
				</li>
				<li>
					At this point, I think it's a good idea to limit my scope into 
					one year of data (2000), because having data from both 2000 and 1900 
					may be a bit overwhelming / may clutter the visualization
				</li>
				<li>
					I think the numerical difference between gender populations
					may be more impactful than percent difference or proportion, as it preserves
					the values in the raw data more exactly and shows human scale
				</li>
				<li>
					I might want to explore what visualizing proportion of each gender might 
					look like
				</li>
				<li>
					I could choose between displaying birth year (more of a timeline) over 
					age, to give a timeline feel for the graphic. This graphic currently has age 
					because including birth year may make the data mislead the reader into thinking 
					the data was collected in that year
				</li>
				<li>
					I definitely want to choose a non blue and pink color scheme to defy gender roles
					when I'm doing part 2 of the assignment
				</li>
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img src="./Vis &amp; Society Assignment 3_files/3.png" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					This sketch displays a stacked bar chart whose bars represent the percent of the 
					population that each gender encompasses
					in the year 2000. The graph can also be read as a simple bar chart using either side's axis,
					where the left side has an increasing scale corresponding to the percentage of men, while the right
					side has a decreasing scale corresponding to the percentage of women.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					I think the stacked bar chart lets the viewer compare between years 
					a little more accurately than the numerical difference chart
				</li>
				<li>
					Though there is some information loss in terms of the difference counts,
					the data normalization is really helpful to see trends in proportion that 
					are not affected by population
				</li>
				<li>
					After making this chart, I realized that the percentage of women increases
					dramatically in the last few age spans, which is a new and exciting finding to 
					highlight!
				</li>
				<li>
					I would want to see if I can incorporate data from the 1900s with this chart,
					but still don't know how to do this in a way that's not too cluttered
				</li>
				<li>
					I'm not sure how easy it is to see the difference in scale between the 49% women
					to 75% women in the chart, so I might want to experiment with a visualization that lets
					you compare proportions a bit easier (Note: I end up doing this in my next sketch)
				</li>
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img src="./Vis &amp; Society Assignment 3_files/2.png" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					This sketch displays the proportion of men versus the proportion of women 
					in pie charts for each 10-year age range in the 2000 year data. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Though I'm not the happiest this visualization, I wanted to make something 
					that allows you to see changes in proportion easily. I chose to use pie charts 
					because I think it's easier for a person to recognize 1/2 and 3/4 of a pie than
					1/2 and 3/4 of a bar
				</li>
				<li>
					Since I didn't want 20 different pie charts to compare with, I 
					also thought it would be a good idea to aggregate the data over 10-year
					age ranges. Aggregating did help make the sketch easier to look at, but there 
					is unfortunately some loss in granularity.
				</li>
				<li>
					I still wanted to easily communicate that the proportion of women drastically increases 
					at the last few age ranges, which I found in the previous sketch, and think that the 
					pie charts are able to provide this information
				</li>
			</ul>
