			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>
		<p>
			My question for visualization was initially "How does the difference 
			in gender populations vary based on birth year?" In part 2, I decided
			to shift my question to "How do the trends in the 
			gender ratio across age compare for 1900 and 2000?"

				<figcaption>
					This sketch displays the numberical difference between men and women for each age range in 
					the year 2000. If a bar is below the x axis, that range has more men, and 
					if a bar is above the x axis, that range has more women.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					This preliminary graph looks like a very nice sine curve so far!
				</li>
				<li>
					At this point, I think it's a good idea to limit my scope into 
					one year of data (2000), because having data from both 2000 and 1900 
					may be a bit overwhelming / may clutter the visualization
				</li>
				<li>
					I think the numerical difference between gender populations
					may be more impactful than percent difference or proportion, as it preserves
					the values in the raw data more exactly and shows human scale
				</li>
				<li>
					I might want to explore what visualizing proportion of each gender might 
					look like
				</li>
				<li>
					I could choose between displaying birth year (more of a timeline) over 
					age, to give a timeline feel for the graphic. This graphic currently has age 
					because including birth year may make the data mislead the reader into thinking 
					the data was collected in that year
				</li>
				<li>
					I definitely want to choose a non blue and pink color scheme to defy gender roles
					when I'm doing part 2 of the assignment
				</li>
			</ul>


      <figure>
				<img src="./Vis &amp; Society Assignment 3_files/2.png" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					This sketch displays the proportion of men versus the proportion of women 
					in pie charts for each 10-year age range in the 2000 year data. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Though I'm not the happiest this visualization, I wanted to make something 
					that allows you to see changes in proportion easily. I chose to use pie charts 
					because I think it's easy for a person to recognize a fraction of a pie 
				</li>
				<li>
					Though there is some information loss in terms of the difference counts,
					the data normalization is really helpful to see trends in proportion that 
					are not affected by population
				</li>
				<li>
					Since I didn't want 20 different pie charts to compare with, I 
					also thought it would be a good idea to aggregate the data over 10-year
					age ranges. Aggregating did help make the sketch easier to look at, but there 
					is unfortunately some loss in granularity.
				</li>
				<li>
					Through this sketch, I found that the proportion of women drastically increases 
					at the last few age ranges, which is something that I hope is commmunicated
					through these pie charts
				</li>
				
				<li>
					I think I would want to find a way to make an uncluttered visualization with 
					disaggregated data and still allow 
					for a viewer to see the decreasing trend within the proportions.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<figure>
				<img src="./Vis &amp; Society Assignment 3_files/3.png" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					This sketch displays a stacked bar chart whose bars represent the percent of the 
					population that each gender encompasses
					in the year 2000. The graph can also be read as a simple bar chart using either side's axis,
					where the left side has an increasing scale corresponding to the percentage of men, while the right
					side has a decreasing scale corresponding to the percentage of women.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					I think the stacked bar chart lets the viewer compare between years 
					a little more accurately than the numerical difference chart and pie charts
				</li>
				<li>
					I would want to see if I can incorporate data from the 1900s with this chart,
					but still don't know how to do this in a way that's not too cluttered
				</li>
				<li>
					Though I feel it's easier to estimate proportions using pie charts, I hope 
					that stacked bars will be able to provide a similar amount of visual information
				</li>
				<li>
					I like that a stacked bar chart let you read a graph both right side up and upside down,
					and decided to include an axis on both sides of the bars, where once increases in scale while 
					the other decreases in scale
				</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
		While each of my designs has varied strengths and weaknesses, I believe I am happiest with my 3rd design.
		My first design is nice because it preserves the numerical differences between men and women and also only 
		includes one bar per age range, giving it a shape that I feel is very easy to follow. However, I've realized 
		through my second and third designs that raw counts may not tell the full story of this data. My 2nd and 3rd 
		designs instead display the <i>proportion</i> of men and women for each age range, normalizing these counts 
		into percentages that can be compared more plausibly. My second design has its benefits because is takes advantage 
		of how easy it is to read general fractions on a circle. However, minute differences between two pie charts are 
		difficult to perceive, and this visualization may require many charts unless the age ranges are aggregated. My third 
		design addresses these issues because it puts the pie chart proportions into bars that can be put next to each other
		for much simpler comparison that can accommodate all age ranges without being too overwhelming to look at. As stated in 
		my rationale, I also like my third visualization a lot because it can be read as a simple bar chart representing either 
		percent male or percent female population, depending on what axis you use. For the next part of this assignment, I hope 
		to use my 2nd design as inspiration and think about if it's possible to include data from the 1900s set.

			<h2>Phase Two: Final Design</h2>

			<figure>
				<img src="./Vis &amp; Society Assignment 3_files/A3.jpg" alt="">
				<figcaption>
				This is an overlaid stacked bar chart that incorporates data from 1900 and 2000.
				It uses orange and dark blue to represent the proportion of men and women for a 
				particular age range in the year 2000, and yellow and light blue 
				to represent the proportion of men and women for a particular age range in the year 1900.

			<h2>Design Process &amp; Design Decisions</h2>

			
			<p>
				When designing my final visualization, I began by trying to recreate the 
				third visualzation sketch I made in part 1. My visual encodings included a 
				stacked bar chart with inverted dual axes that scaled from 0 to 100 percent.
				After this point, I began to get curious about incorportating data from 1900.
				So, I decided to slightly modify my focus question to "How do the trends in the 
				gender ratio across age compare for 1900 and 2000?" Though this may have been an ambitious design decision, I felt that 
				it would allow me to take full advantage of the data provided and potentially create a 
				visualization that could allow for a variety of information to be drawn from it.
      		</p>
			<p>
				With my changed research question, I decided to make a second bar chart for the 1900
				data that mirrored the one for 2000. Then, I experimented with ways to overlay these two 
				stacked bar charts. By playing around with color, width, and opacity, I ended up with the
				visualization above. First, I chose a light and dark orange to represent men and a light and 
				dark blue to represent women. I chose not to map women to pink and men to blue, as has 
				been done historically in data visualizations, to do my part in breaking gender stereotyping.
				Additionally, I chose to use a thin bar and dark colors for the 2000 data to make it 
				easily differentiable from the wide bar and light/opaque colors of the 1900 data. By choosing one 
				visual encoding to emphasize for both the 1900 and 2000 data (width and color intensity, repectively),
				I feel that I was able to get an output visualization that encompasses a great deal of information, 
				is not too cluttered, and can be read in multiple ways to realize gender ratio trends from 1900 and 2000.
				Given this visualization, I hope to communicate that in both 1900 and 2000, the gender ratio 
				is very close to 50/50 for ages up to thirty. Afterwards, the women become an increasingly large 
				majority of the population, though the scale of that increate is much larger in 2000, where women 
				are 75% of the population over 90, compared to 57% of the population in 1900.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        To be honest,
		I was tempted to skip part 1 and make visualizations without sketching at all first.
		In hindsight, I am very glad that I made my sketches. 
		This process helped me question every element I decided to bring into my visualization; these 
		were no longer default settings that could appear at a click of a button. Instead, I found myself
		thinking about decisions such as changing my x-axis representation to birth year rather than age range,
		which I thought about only because I found writing "0 to 5; 5 to 10; 10 to 15" too tedious. Though I 
		chose to stick with age ranges for my final visualization, I feel much more confident about using them.
		
		In addition to these smaller design decisions, the sketches helped me grapple with two main concerns:
		if I should include data for both years (1900 and 2000) and whether I should represent
		gender differences through pure numerical counts or through ratios. 
		Though I wasn't able to figure the first concern out through my sketches, 
		this line of thinking about incorporating both 1900 and 2000 data put me on the right
		track for making my final visualization that overlaid stacked bar graphs for each year. 
		Meanwhile, I was able to make a decision to 
		use ratios instead of counts in my final design because I found such neat trends in my sketches.
